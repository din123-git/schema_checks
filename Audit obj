To find out which objects a specific service account has accessed in BigQuery over the last six months, you can query the BigQuery audit logs. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. Set up Audit Logs

BigQuery automatically logs activities, including data access, through the Cloud Audit Logs. The specific log type for data access in BigQuery is the bigquery.googleapis.com/data_access log.

2. Query the Audit Logs

You can run the following SQL in the *_TABLES of the cloudaudit_googleapis_com_data_access logs dataset in your Google Cloud project:

SELECT
  protopayload_auditlog.authenticationInfo.principalEmail AS service_account,
  protopayload_auditlog.resourceName AS resource_name,
  protopayload_auditlog.serviceData.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.createTime AS access_time,
  protopayload_auditlog.methodName AS access_method
FROM
  `project_id.region.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_data_access_*`
WHERE
  protopayload_auditlog.authenticationInfo.principalEmail = 'service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
  AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), protopayload_auditlog.serviceData.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.createTime, MONTH) <= 6
  AND protopayload_auditlog.serviceName = 'bigquery.googleapis.com'
ORDER BY
  access_time DESC

Explanation of the Query

project_id.region.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_data_access_*: Replace project_id and region with your specific project ID and log dataset region.

protopayload_auditlog.authenticationInfo.principalEmail: This field identifies the email address of the service account accessing the objects.

protopayload_auditlog.resourceName: This field specifies the BigQuery object (table, view, etc.) being accessed.

protopayload_auditlog.serviceData.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.createTime: The timestamp of when the access event occurred.

access_method: Provides the method used for the access, like querying a table, listing datasets, etc.

Date Filter: Filters access events that occurred in the last six months.


Important Notes

1. You need to have the necessary permissions (bigquery.admin or logging.viewer) to access the audit logs.


2. The audit logs must be enabled for the project; if not, enable them through the Google Cloud Console.


3. Adjust the dataset region and project_id in the log table name according to your setup.



This query provides a detailed log of all the access events by the specified service account in the past six months.
