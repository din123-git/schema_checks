You are correct, `predecessor_impacts` is not fully qualified in the recursive CTE. Here's the corrected query:

```
WITH 
  filtered_jobs AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM ldw_admin.CTM_JOB_T 
    WHERE UPPER(CTM_JOB_NM) IN (UPPER('abcdefg')) 
      AND PRED_TYPE_CD = 'PRED' 
      AND CTM_JOB_NM <> PRED_CTM_JOB_NM
  ),
  predecessor_impacts AS (
    SELECT 
      CTM_JOB_NM AS CTM_JOB,
      PRED_CTM_JOB_NM AS parent_ctm_job,
      CTM_JOB_NM AS child_ctm_job,
      1 AS joblevel
    FROM 
      filtered_jobs
  
    UNION ALL
  
    SELECT 
      p.CTM_JOB,
      n.PRED_CTM_JOB_NM AS parent_ctm_job,
      p.parent_ctm_job AS child_ctm_job,
      p.joblevel + 1 AS joblevel
    FROM 
      filtered_jobs n
    INNER JOIN 
      predecessor_impacts p 
      ON n.CTM_JOB_NM = p.parent_ctm_job
    WHERE 
      p.joblevel < 10  -- Adjust recursive depth
  )
SELECT 
  CTM_JOB, 
  parent_ctm_job, 
  child_ctm_job, 
  joblevel
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      *, 
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CTM_JOB, parent_ctm_job, child_ctm_job ORDER BY joblevel) AS row_num
    FROM 
      predecessor_impacts
  ) AS predecessor_impacts_final
WHERE 
  row_num = 1
ORDER BY 
  CTM_JOB, 
  joblevel, 
  parent_ctm_job, 
  child_ctm_job;
```

Changes made:

- Fully qualified `predecessor_impacts` in the recursive CTE by assigning table aliases (`p` and `n`).
- Added an alias (`predecessor_impacts_final`) to the final `SELECT` statement to avoid confusion with the CTE name.

This query should now execute without errors.
