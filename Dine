# Replace "true" with "false" in the CSV file
sed -i 's/true/false/g' your_file.csv


To achieve this in BigQuery, you can use the following approaches:

*Approach 1: IGNORE NULLS with DISTINCT*
```
SELECT DISTINCT IGNORE NULLS 
       table_name,
       date,
       CASE 
           WHEN a.date = b.date THEN email 
           ELSE NULL 
       END AS email
FROM ...
```

*Approach 2: COALESCE with MAX*
```
SELECT DISTINCT 
       table_name,
       date,
       COALESCE(
           CASE 
               WHEN a.date = b.date THEN email 
               ELSE NULL 
           END, 
           MAX(email) OVER (PARTITION BY table_name, date)  -- assuming email is not array
       ) AS email
FROM ...
```

*Approach 3: FILTER before DISTINCT*
```
SELECT DISTINCT 
       table_name,
       date,
       email
FROM (
  SELECT 
       table_name,
       date,
       CASE 
           WHEN a.date = b.date THEN email 
           ELSE NULL 
       END AS email
  FROM ...
)
WHERE 
    email IS NOT NULL
```

However, this last approach will exclude rows where `email` is `NULL`.

*Approach 4: Using SUBQUERY*
```
SELECT 
    table_name,
    date,
    (SELECT DISTINCT email 
     FROM ... 
     WHERE a.date = b.date) AS email
FROM ...
```

Choose the approach that best fits your use case.

Additional suggestions:

- Verify data types: Ensure `date` columns have the same data type.
- Check join conditions: Ensure join conditions are correct.
- Analyze data distribution: Understand why 9 out of 10 records have `NULL` emails.

If issues persist or you need further assistance, please provide:

1. Sample data
2. Table schema
3. Expected output

This will help identify the root cause.
